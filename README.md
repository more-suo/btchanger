# How did I manage my work?

## Part 1

**Spent time: 1h**

I decided what framwork to use. At first I wanted to create a mega-professional API-system on Django to show my skills. But then I realized I don't need Django, because it's not really lightweight... So I decided to use Sanic, because it's more lightweight and that's what the cool kids use ðŸ˜Ž _But then_ I realized ~~again~~ that I don't need the asynchronous part of it... At the I decided to use Flask.


## Part 2

**Spent time: 1.5h**

I searched for the right API to collect data and decided how to call endpoints the endpoints. I followed the REST API "best practices" and requirements to create the json-response-structure and to call the API-endpoints. 


## Part 3

**Spent time: 3-4h**

I relized the API. There's nothing more to say here xD


## Part 4

**Spent time: 1h**

Code refactoring and documentation. I simplified some functions, renamed two variables for better readability and add a small documentation to the functions, where I thought it would be useful.
